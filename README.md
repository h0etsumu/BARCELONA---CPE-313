I am Jacob Seth S. Barcelona, a 3rd year CpE student - currently taking the Data Science track elective. A 21-year-old ENFJ-T who is engrossed in K-pop and J-pop. 

A regular student who loves to write researches, and hopes that he doesn't flop on that area. I want to try and excel beyond my standards, 
and so I impulsively bought 2 for dummies book in relation to my track, hehe. I'll utilize it! (Hopefully ><)
